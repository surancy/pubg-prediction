### Project Pipeline
![pipeline](https://github.com/surancy/pubg-prediction/blob/master/pubg-pipeline.jpg) .   
After the data was scrapped from PUBG api and preprocessed, the preliminary analysis was ran for exploring correlation among variables and detect outliers. Both supervised and unsupervised machine learning models were used here, with the supervised learning to predict the player's winning place, and the unsupervised learning to segment players. The final evaluation was to find out insights after machine learning models were built, and provide actionable recommendations for both developers and gamers.
